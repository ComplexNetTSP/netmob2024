      Data Challenge

      Colocated with NetMob 2023, we are launching the NetMob 2023 Data Challenge. The challenge aims at deriving new knowledge from the analysis, characterization, modelling and cross-correlation of an original high-resolution dataset describing mobile service usage in multiple regions of France.
